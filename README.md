# Covid-19 Data Exploration - SQL Project

## Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL and to visualize some key insights using Tableau. The dataset includes information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics. The goal of this project is to analyze the data to uncover insights such as infection rates, death percentages, vaccination progress, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two main tables:
1. **Covid_Deaths**: Contains information about COVID-19 cases and deaths.
2. **Covid_Vaccinations**: Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplifying complex queries.
- **Temp Tables**: Storing intermediate results for further analysis.
- **Window Functions**: Calculating rolling totals and partitioned aggregations.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Summarizing data (e.g., `SUM`, `MAX`, `AVG`).
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converting data types for calculations.
- **Views**: Creating reusable virtual tables for visualization.
